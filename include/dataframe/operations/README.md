# Operations
Simple operations to generate new Series from existaing ones.

1. Folder `math` for all basic math ops
1. Folder `geo` stands for geo-metry, geo-physics and so on.
1. Folder `algebra` is for linear algebra
1. Folder `stats` is for statistics

# TODO
Some examples of what is possible to do (See the [this lib](https://github.com/youwol/math) in TypeScript).

- For `math`:
    - invert
    - mult
    - rand
    - round
    - shuffle
    - square
    - abs
    - ...

- For `geo`:
    - interpolate
    - gaussianCurvature
    - ...

- For `algebra`:
    - mult (mat x vec)
    - cross
    - det
    - inv
    - normalize
    - rotate
    - ...

- For `stats`:
    - quantile
    - mean
    - variance
    - weightedMean
    - covariance
    - std
    - ...
