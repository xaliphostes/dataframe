/**
 * @brief A k-dimensional tree implementation for spatial queries on Serie data
 * types
 *
 * The KDTree class provides an efficient spatial indexing structure for
 * performing nearest neighbor searches on Serie data types in k-dimensional
 * space. It supports both 2D and 3D spatial coordinates through template
 * specialization.
 *
 * The tree maintains a spatial hierarchy of points while preserving the
 * association with arbitrary data stored in the Serie. This allows for
 * efficient spatial queries while maintaining access to the associated data.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Template-based design supporting any data type T
 * - Specialized for 2D and 3D spaces using Vector2 and Vector3 types
 * - Efficient nearest neighbor search
 * - K-nearest neighbors search capability
 * - Memory-efficient implementation using smart pointers
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * // Create sample data for 2D space
 * Serie<std::string> labels{"A", "B", "C", "D"};
 * Serie<Vector2> positions{
 *     {0.0, 0.0},
 *     {1.0, 1.0},
 *     {2.0, 0.0},
 *     {0.0, 2.0}
 * };
 *
 * // Create KDTree
 * KDTree<std::string, 2> tree(labels, positions);
 *
 * // Find nearest neighbor
 * Vector2 queryPoint{1.5, 1.5};
 * auto [index, value] = tree.findNearest(queryPoint);
 *
 * // Find k nearest neighbors for multiple points
 * Serie<Vector2> queryPoints{{1.0, 1.0}, {2.0, 2.0}};
 * auto neighbors = tree.findNearest(queryPoints, 2);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The size of the position Serie must match the size of the data Serie.
 * @warning The tree structure is immutable after construction. For dynamic
 * point sets, a new tree must be constructed.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of data stored in the Serie
 * @tparam DIM The dimension of the space (2 or 3)
